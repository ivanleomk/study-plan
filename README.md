# Introduction

I'm currently working as a Research Engineer at 567 after a few years as a software engineer. I don't think I have the right amount of technicals to do what I'd like to do so this is a small study plan that I'll be slowly updating over the next few months.

My main goals are as follows

1. Learn Rust
2. Get more experience working with models other than OpenAI - exploring the fine-tuning and continued pre-training stage more
3. Study up on ML Fundamentals

If you've got any recomendations for things to do, feel free to make a PR or open an issue. I'll be more than happy to add it in.
